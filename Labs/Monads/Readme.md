# ðŸ§ª MonadsLabProject â€“ Interactive .NET Lab on Monads

Welcome to an **interactive gamified workshop** to learn about monads in C#/.NET! âœ¨

This project is designed for developers who want to understand and practice monads step by step, through hands-on coding challenges. You will:

- Discover the concept of monads and their usefulness in functional programming.
- Implement your own `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` monads in C#.
- Learn how to chain operations and handle errors in a functional style.
- Explore advanced topics like asynchronous monads and monad composition.

The lab is divided into 4 levels of increasing difficulty:

1. **Option Monad:** Implement a basic `Option<T>` to represent optional values.
2. **Option Chaining:** Use your monad to chain computations that may fail.
3. **Result Monad:** Add error propagation with a `Result<T, E>` type.
4. **Async & Composition:** Combine monads and handle asynchronous effects.

Each level contains a problem statement and a solution template. You are encouraged to solve each exercise before looking at the provided solution.

## ðŸš€ How to run the lab

Clone the repository and run the project:

```bash
dotnet run
```

You can explore each level in the `Labs/Monads/LevelX` folders. Edit, run, and test your code as you progress!
